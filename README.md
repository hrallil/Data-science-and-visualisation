# Data Science and Visualization (F23)

This is an entry-level course on fundamental principles, computing techniques, and programming tools of data science and visualization. The course is offered partly to meet the increasing needs from RUC students who encounter and process many different kinds of data in their daily study and research.

The course will cover what data science is about, data types and data science process, typical machine learning models, and popular data mining techniques. The course will also cover data visualization in the context of data science.

As Data Science is very hands-on by nature, the course will use Jupyter Notebook as the platform. We will also introduce Python programming briefly at the beginning if necessary, and continuously use Python during the course in the context of Jupter Notebook.

In addition, the course will have a group-based mini-project. For the mini-projects, real datasets and research questions will be suggested. Nevertheless, the students are more encouraged to work on datasets and data-driven questions from their own study or research domain.

A tentative course schedule is given below on this page. More information will be avaiable in Moodle later as we move futher into the semester of F23.

## Books (optional):
We don't have any mandatory textbooks for this course. Nevertheless, if you would feel more comfortable or confident by having books in your learning process, you may refer to the following books. The first two books may be the easiest to follow and the most useful for most students.

#### Sinan Ozdemir: Principle of Data Science, Packt, 2016 (Principles of Data Science | Packt (packtpub.com)) 
This is a good 'first' book for data science. It covers the basic concepts, process and data types of data science. It also covers essential mathematics and statistics needed for data science.       

#### Wes McKinney: Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython, 2nd edition, O'Reilly Medi (Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition [Book] (oreilly.com))
This book elaborates on how to use the most popular data science related libraries Pandas and NumPy in Jupter Notebook. 

#### Joel Grus: Data Science from Scratch,  O'Reilly, 2019 (Data Science from Scratch, 2nd Edition [Book] (oreilly.com) )
This is a comprehensive book that covers almost all aspects of data science, e.g., math (linear algebra, statistics, probability), data collection and exploration, machine learning, applications (natural language processing, network analysis, recommender systems), data processing systems (database/SQL, MapReduce). As all topics are covered with Python sample code, the books also uses a chapter to cover Python briefly.

#### Andreas C. Muller and Sarah Guido: Introduction to Machine Learning with Python, O'Reilly, 2016 (Introduction to Machine Learning with Python [Book] (oreilly.com) )
This book starts with a brief yet informative coverage of Python libraries and tools for machine learning. Subsequently, the book elaborates on  essential concepts, models and algorithmes of machine learning, using Python as the programming language.

#### Rachel Schutt and Cathy Oâ€™Neil: Doing Data Science, O'Reilly, 2013 (Doing Data Science [Book] (oreilly.com) )
Relatively speaking, this book is advanced and a bit comprehensive. It mixes techniques and models with real applications, and contains many interesting domain-specific applications such as spam filtering, financial modeling, recommender systems, fraud detection, social networks and epidemiology. The sample code in this book is written in R. This book is only recommended if you're already comfortable and skilled with Data Science and/or you want to get inspirations about advanced applications of Data Science.

## Software:

We will use the following software for this course:

`Anaconda Individual Edition` (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) [Jupyter Notebook included. For Data Science :=)]

`Python 3.9.0` (https://www.python.org/downloads/) [Only for pure Python programming]
